# The Crystal Mines
This is my 4th year Final Project for the Creative Computing course in IADT <br />
In this project I Create a 2D metroidvania video game, my inspiration for making this game was greatly influenced by the game "Hollow Knight". The game was created using Unity and can run from an exe file.

## Version 2
This version is what I have done since leaving college.<br />
This will be updated with what has been added.<br />

## Goals
my goals for this version is to update (refactor) the current code to be easier to undedrstand and to be better. <br /> The goal is to update the code to work as it currently works and then once it is refactored i can change it to be as originally intended. <br />
Character states need to be implemented as the current way of having the player animations correct is wildly inefficient. <br />

### Refactoring code
#### Character states 
instead of update() controlling the animations that should be played.<br />
#### Knockback added to attacks 
this will be easier to add once states are implemented.<br />
#### Heal
a way for the character to heal. <br />
