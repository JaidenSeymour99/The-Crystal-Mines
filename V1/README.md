# The Crystal Mines
This is my 4th year Final Project for the Creative Computing course in IADT
In this project I Create a 2D metroidvania video game, my inspiration for making this game was greatly influenced by the game "Hollow Knight". The game was created using Unity and can run from an exe file.

## Version 1
This version is what I have done during college. Below is a screencast showing off the game at the end of version 1.
